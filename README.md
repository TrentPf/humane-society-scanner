# Humane Society Scanner App

This app is designed to pull the current lost pets on the KW humane society page and cross-reference them with previously pulled pets to see if any new pets have been added to the website.

The purpose for this app is because my cat is missing and it's getting difficult to remember which pets I've seen already day-to-day, especially when an image is not provided. Most of the time the name is the same as the pet's id, so when there's no image and a random string of numbers, it gets difficult to remember what's different.

This app displays any new pets and saves the updated list of the current pets so that it can be referenced at a later date when new pets arrive again.
